This code to detect credit fraud detection using Logistic Regression.
Goal: To predict whether transaction is fraud or not.
Flow of code is divided into various steps:
1. Input Data: Data can be found at Kaggle Dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/c/ieee-fraud-detection/data
Data set contains train and test data saperately.
